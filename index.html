          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Even though Poverty and Healthcare are two topics that may look as pretty opposite, with the common assumption that the poorer a place is, the 
            worse the Healthcare is, the chart shows that this correlation exists however its not as drastic as one may think. There are states like Texas that
            are not in the top of poor cities that lack healthcare in a great number. However this data can be seen as an outlier and we can safely assume that the
            state, more people lack healthcare.
